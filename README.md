# video-game-human-detection-mouse-movement-support
yolov4 human body detection applied in first-person shooting game.  
No data reading from memory, no data reading from the game file, and no interaction with the game.  
**--> Can not be detected by any anti-cheat software.**  
The model running at 30 fps(very fast, 15 fps is enough) depends on the graphic card.  
**For me 1080ti 400fps for cs:go while 30fps for model.**  
The code only works on non-kernel anti-cheat games.

The code only works on CUDA-based graphic cards.  
Code only for research purposes, not allow any business usage.  
For a better gaming environment, I won't post my code directly.
